Query Translation for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)Applications
Enhance RAG’s Insights: Optimizing Data Context for Better Results


Computing Distance Between Query and Document

Vector Store Implementation for Similarity Search

Query Translation methods:
- Multi-Query
- Rag-Fusion
- Query Decomposition
    - Recursive Answering Approach
    - Parallel Answering Approach
    - Sub Question Query Engine (A parallel prompting tool in llama-index)
- Step Back Prompting
- HyDE — Hypothetical Document Embeddings


Modern approaches often use large language models trained on query-to-code pairs, semantic parsing techniques, and retrieval-augmented generation to improve accuracy and handle edge cases more effectively.

Issues with Basiv RAG flow:
- Recal and precission in document retrival : When building a knoledge base for the retrieval of phase of a RAG application, we need to consider the tradeoff between recal and precission, and it's impact on the performance of the RAG system
